# shaarli-related
I am a [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli) plugin to show related links based on the number of identical tags. I enable a different way to explore the links between your links.

## What I look like

Find me in my natural environment on https://b.ndre.gr

## Install me
- Download my source code: https://github.com/ilesinge/shaarli-related/archive/master.zip
- Unpack it
- Place the "related" folder inside the "plugins" folder of your Shaarli
- Access the Plugin administration page of your Shaarli
- Enable the "related" plugin

## QA
I was tested on Shaarli v.0.9, with the default, vintage and material themes.

If you find any bug, or have some ideas, open a github issue! Pull requests are welcome.

## Ideas
If anybody needs it, we could add some configuration options to define:
- the number of related links to show
- whether we show inline description of related links
- the length of the inline description
- whether a click on a related link should lead to the final URL or the short Shaarli URL
